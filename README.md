# BotoSeis distribution

This repository is meant for distributing BotoSeis.

The `bin` directory has the contents of the `dist` directory, which was generated by NetBeans when building the project and it also has some shell scripts that must be set in `PATH` for the program to work properly.

This project was built with Apache NetBeans IDE 12.0 and Java SE Development Kit 11.0.8.
